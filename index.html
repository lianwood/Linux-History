        <h1>How the Linux works </h1>
        <p>Linux is an operating system. It manages all the hardware resources associated with your desktop/laptop. <br>
            The Linux has 7 parts to it. <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The first part is called the Bootloader. This manages the boot process of your computer.<br>
        <li>Second is the Kernel. This part is actually the Linux. It is the core of the system and manages the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.<br>
        <li>Third is the Daemons. They are background services (printing, sound, scheduling) that start after you log in or start during boot.<br>
        <li>Fourth is the Shell. The Shell is a command process that allows you to control your computer by using commands. <br>
        <li>Fifth is the Graphical Server. It is a sub-system that displays the graphics on your monitor. <br>
        <li>Sixth is the Desktop Environment. There are many to choose from (Unity, GNOME, Cinnamon, Enlightenment, KDE, XFCE etc.) Each one includes
        built-in applications ( web browsers, games, configuration tools, and file managers) <br>
        <li>The Seventh part is the applications. Desktop Environments don't offer a full aray of apps. Linux offers software titles that can be
        easily found and installed. For example, the App Store.
        </ul>

        <p>I think Linux is an important invention to the history of computers because it is the operating system of computers. It is the the main
        part of the computer. It plays a huge role in managing your computer. It allows you to download softwares and apps you dont already have.
        Thanks to the Linux we can download apps, control our compiter by commands, and have background services. </p>
