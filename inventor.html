        <h1>The Inventor of the Linux </h1>
        
        <p> Linus Torvalds is the inventor of Linux. Linus was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. 
        He was a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland where he had been using Minix. He majored in computer science. 
        He bought his first computer in 1987. It was a Sinclair QL. In 1990 Linus took his first C programming language class. He used this 
        language to write Linux. In 1991 Linus sent out a message it said "Hello everybody out there... I'm doing a (free) operating system
        (just a hobby, won't be anything big and profesional like gnu)...it will probably never support anything other than AT-hard disks, 
        as that's all I have. He chose a penguin its his mascot.
